Certainly! We can modify the script to include a new field called "pondering" with a randomly selected line from the provided text file. Let's update our script to incorporate this new feature.



```python
import pandas as pd
import os
from datetime import datetime
import random

def get_processed_ids(file_path):
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        return set(pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None)[0])
    return set()

def save_processed_ids(file_path, ids):
    pd.DataFrame(list(ids)).to_csv(file_path, index=False, header=False)

def get_random_pondering(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        ponderings = file.readlines()
    return random.choice(ponderings).strip()

def process_new_records():
    # File to store processed IDs
    processed_ids_file = "processed_ids.csv"
    processed_ids = get_processed_ids(processed_ids_file)

    # Read the lookup file into a DataFrame
    df_lookup = pd.read_csv("city_lookup.csv")

    # Read the customer data file into a DataFrame
    df_customers = pd.read_csv("customers-10000.csv")

    # Get all current customer IDs
    current_ids = set(df_customers["Customer Id"])

    # Remove processed IDs that are no longer in the data file
    processed_ids = processed_ids.intersection(current_ids)

    # Filter to only include rows where Country is 'United States' and Customer Id is new
    df_customers_filtered = df_customers[
        (df_customers["Country"] == "United States") & 
        (~df_customers["Customer Id"].isin(processed_ids))
    ]

    if df_customers_filtered.empty:
        print("No new records to process.")
        save_processed_ids(processed_ids_file, processed_ids)  # Save updated processed IDs
        return

    # Merge the filtered customer DataFrame with the lookup DataFrame
    df_merged = df_customers_filtered.merge(
        df_lookup[["City", "UUID", "ZIP Code", "Area Code"]], on="City", how="left"
    )

    # Combine 'First Name' and 'Last Name' into 'Legal Name'
    df_merged["Legal Name"] = df_merged["First Name"] + " " + df_merged["Last Name"]

    # Add a new column 'Reviewed' with the static text "Reviewed by Bob"
    df_merged["Reviewed"] = "Reviewed by Bob"

    # Add a new column 'Pondering' with a random pondering for each row
    df_merged["Pondering"] = df_merged.apply(lambda _: get_random_pondering("pondering2.txt"), axis=1)

    # Apply the column mapping
    column_mapping = {
        "Customer Id": "ID",
        "Email": "email address",
        "Legal Name": "Legal Name",
        "UUID": "UUID",
        "Reviewed": "Reviewed",
        "ZIP Code": "ZIP Code",
        "Area Code": "Area Code",
        "Pondering": "Pondering"
    }

    # Get current date for file naming
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")

    # Iterate through unique cities and create a new file for each city
    for city in df_merged["City"].unique():
        df_city = df_merged[df_merged["City"] == city]
        df_city_mapped = df_city[list(column_mapping.keys())].rename(columns=column_mapping)
        
        # Define the file name based on the city and current date
        file_name = f"datavue_{city.replace(' ', '_').replace('/', '_')}_{current_date}.csv"
        
        # Write the DataFrame to a new CSV file
        df_city_mapped.to_csv(file_name, index=False)
        
        print(f"The new data for {city} has been written to '{file_name}'.")

    # Update processed IDs
    processed_ids.update(df_merged["Customer Id"])
    save_processed_ids(processed_ids_file, processed_ids)

    print(f"Processed {len(df_merged)} new records.")
    print(f"Total records in processed IDs: {len(processed_ids)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_new_records()

```

Here's an explanation of the changes made to the script:

1. We've added a new function `get_random_pondering()` that reads the pondering file and returns a random line:

   ```python
   def get_random_pondering(file_path):
       with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
           ponderings = file.readlines()
       return random.choice(ponderings).strip()
   ```

2. We've added a new column 'Pondering' to the DataFrame, populating it with a random pondering for each row:

   ```python
   df_merged["Pondering"] = df_merged.apply(lambda _: get_random_pondering("pondering2.txt"), axis=1)
   ```

3. We've updated the `column_mapping` dictionary to include the new 'Pondering' field:

   ```python
   column_mapping = {
       # ... other fields ...
       "Pondering": "Pondering"
   }
   ```

These changes ensure that:
- Each new record processed will have a randomly selected pondering from the "pondering2.txt" file.
- The pondering will be included in the output CSV files for each city.

Please note that this implementation assigns a new random pondering to each record. If you want the same pondering for all records processed in a single run, you can move the `get_random_pondering()` call outside the `apply` function and assign it to all rows at once.

Make sure that the "pondering2.txt" file is in the same directory as your script, or provide the full path to the file in the `get_random_pondering()` function call.

This updated script will now include the new "Pondering" field in your output files, adding an interesting and unique element to each processed record.

I apologize for the oversight. You're right; the issue you're describing suggests that the script is only writing the first file and then stopping, even though it's updating the processed IDs. Let's fix this issue and ensure that all city files are written correctly.

    print(f"Processed {len(df_merged)} new records.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_new_records()

```

Here are the key changes and explanations:

1. The main structure of the script remains the same, ensuring that we're still filtering for new records and processing them correctly.

2. The critical fix is in how we handle the processed IDs. Previously, we were updating the `processed_ids` set within the loop, which could have led to issues. Now, we collect all the new IDs first and then update the set once at the end:

   ```python
   # Update processed IDs
   new_processed_ids = set(df_merged["Customer Id"])
   processed_ids.update(new_processed_ids)
   save_processed_ids(processed_ids_file, processed_ids)
   ```

3. This change ensures that all new records are processed and written to their respective city files before updating the processed IDs file.

4. The loop that writes files for each city remains unchanged, which means it should now correctly write a file for each unique city in the new records.

These modifications should resolve the issue you were experiencing. The script will now:

1. Process all new records.
2. Write a file for each unique city among those new records.
3. Update the processed IDs file with all the new IDs at the end.

To verify that this is working correctly, you can add some additional logging. For example, after the loop that writes the city files, you could add:

```python
print(f"Files written for cities: {', '.join(df_merged['City'].unique())}")
```

This will give you a list of all the cities for which files were written in each run.

If you're still experiencing issues after these changes, please let me know, and we can further investigate and refine the script.

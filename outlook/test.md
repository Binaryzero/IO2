I apologize for the oversight. You're right, we're missing the 'vulnerable_hosts_by_priority' in the template.format() call. Let's fix this error by adding the missing variable to the format call. We'll update the `generate_html_report` function once again to include this.

In this updated version of the `generate_html_report` function, I've made the following changes:

1. Added `vulnerable_hosts_by_priority` to the list of variables initialized at the beginning of the function.
2. Included `vulnerable_hosts_by_priority` in the `template.format()` call.
3. Also added `due_dates_by_priority` and `vulnerabilities_by_app` to the `template.format()` call to ensure all generated content is passed to the template.

These changes should resolve the KeyError for 'vulnerable_hosts_by_priority' and ensure that all generated content is properly passed to the HTML template.

To make sure everything works correctly, please check that your HTML template (`report_template.html`) has placeholders for all these variables:

- `{vulnerable_hosts_by_priority}`
- `{due_dates_by_priority}`
- `{vulnerabilities_by_app}`

If any of these placeholders are missing in your template, you'll need to add them where appropriate.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain further about this update?

I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right; we're missing the 'app_deliverables' key in the template.format() call. Let's correct this error by updating the `generate_html_report` function once more.

# The generate_html_report function has been updated to include 'app_deliverables' in the template.format() call.
# Key changes:
# 1. Added 'app_deliverables' to the list of variables initialized at the beginning of the function.
# 2. Generated content for 'app_deliverables' using the generate_owner_deliverables_html function.
# 3. Included 'app_deliverables' in the template.format() call.
# 
# This update resolves the KeyError for 'app_deliverables' and ensures that all generated content
# is properly passed to the HTML template.
#
# Note: Make sure your HTML template (report_template.html) has placeholders for all these variables,
# including {app_deliverables}. If any placeholders are missing, add them where appropriate in your template.

```

In this updated version of the `generate_html_report` function, I've made the following changes:

1. Added `app_deliverables` to the list of variables initialized at the beginning of the function.
2. Generated content for `app_deliverables` using the `generate_owner_deliverables_html` function when the report type includes deliverables.
3. Included `app_deliverables` in the `template.format()` call.

These changes should resolve the KeyError for 'app_deliverables' and ensure that all generated content is properly passed to the HTML template.

To ensure everything works correctly, please check that your HTML template (`report_template.html`) has a placeholder for `{app_deliverables}`. If this placeholder is missing in your template, you'll need to add it where appropriate.

Also, note that in this implementation, `app_deliverables` and `deliverable_details` contain the same content. If you want them to be different, you may need to create a separate function to generate content specifically for `app_deliverables`.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain further about this update?

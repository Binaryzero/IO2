I apologize for that oversight. You're absolutely right. Let's correct the executive summary to include the deliverables information again. I'll update the `generate_executive_summary` function in the `report_generation.py` file to reincorporate the deliverables summary.

# ... (rest of the file remains the same)

# The executive summary has been updated to include both the deliverables summary and the vulnerability summary.
# Key changes:
# 1. Reintroduced the deliverables summary section at the beginning of the executive summary.
# 2. Added a table showing owners with past due or soon-to-be-due deliverables.
# 3. Kept the vulnerability summary, including information about exceptions and acceptable use cases.
# 4. Updated the final statement to mention both vulnerabilities and deliverables.
#
# This provides a more comprehensive overview of both deliverables and vulnerabilities in the executive summary.

```

I've made the following changes to correct the executive summary:

1. Reintroduced the deliverables summary section at the beginning of the executive summary.
2. Added a table showing owners with past due or soon-to-be-due deliverables (those due in 0 to 10 days).
3. Kept the vulnerability summary, including information about exceptions and acceptable use cases.
4. Updated the final statement to mention both vulnerabilities and deliverables.

These changes ensure that the executive summary provides a comprehensive overview of both deliverables and vulnerabilities, as it did before. The information about exceptions and acceptable use cases for vulnerabilities has been retained, giving a complete picture of the current status.

The rest of the `report_generation.py` file remains the same as in the previous version. This update corrects the oversight and brings back the important deliverables information to the executive summary.

Is there anything else you'd like to modify or add to the report generation process?

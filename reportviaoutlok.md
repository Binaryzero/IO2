I apologize for the oversight. You're right, and I thank you for catching that error. The issue is that we're using `df_merged` outside of its scope. Let's fix this by restructuring our code to ensure all variables are properly defined and accessible where needed.



```python
import pandas as pd
import os
from datetime import datetime
import random

def get_processed_ids(file_path):
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        return set(pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None)[0])
    return set()

def save_processed_ids(file_path, ids):
    pd.DataFrame(list(ids)).to_csv(file_path, index=False, header=False)

def get_random_pondering(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        ponderings = file.readlines()
    return random.choice(ponderings).strip()

def process_new_records():
    # File to store processed IDs
    processed_ids_file = "processed_ids.csv"
    processed_ids = get_processed_ids(processed_ids_file)

    # Read the lookup file into a DataFrame
    df_lookup = pd.read_csv("city_lookup.csv")

    # Read the customer data file into a DataFrame
    df_customers = pd.read_csv("customers-10000.csv")

    # Get all current customer IDs
    current_ids = set(df_customers["Customer Id"])

    # Remove processed IDs that are no longer in the data file
    processed_ids = processed_ids.intersection(current_ids)

    # Filter to only include rows where Country is 'United States' and Customer Id is new
    df_customers_filtered = df_customers[
        (df_customers["Country"] == "United States") & 
        (~df_customers["Customer Id"].isin(processed_ids))
    ]

    if df_customers_filtered.empty:
        print("No new records to process.")
        save_processed_ids(processed_ids_file, processed_ids)  # Save updated processed IDs
        return

    # Merge the filtered customer DataFrame with the lookup DataFrame
    df_merged = df_customers_filtered.merge(
        df_lookup[["City", "UUID", "ZIP Code", "Area Code"]], on="City", how="left"
    )

    # Combine 'First Name' and 'Last Name' into 'Legal Name'
    df_merged["Legal Name"] = df_merged["First Name"] + " " + df_merged["Last Name"]

    # Add a new column 'Reviewed' with the static text "Reviewed by Bob"
    df_merged["Reviewed"] = "Reviewed by Bob"

    # Add a new column 'Pondering' with a random pondering for each row
    df_merged["Pondering"] = df_merged.apply(lambda _: get_random_pondering("pondering2.txt"), axis=1)

    # Apply the column mapping
    column_mapping = {
        "Customer Id": "ID",
        "Email": "email address",
        "Legal Name": "Legal Name",
        "UUID": "UUID",
        "Reviewed": "Reviewed",
        "ZIP Code": "ZIP Code",
        "Area Code": "Area Code",
        "Pondering": "Pondering"
    }

    # Get current date for file naming
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")

    # Iterate through unique cities and create a new file for each city
    for city in df_merged["City"].unique():
        df_city = df_merged[df_merged["City"] == city]
        df_city_mapped = df_city[list(column_mapping.keys())].rename(columns=column_mapping)
        
        # Define the file name based on the city and current date
        file_name = f"datavue_{city.replace(' ', '_').replace('/', '_')}_{current_date}.csv"
        
        # Write the DataFrame to a new CSV file
        df_city_mapped.to_csv(file_name, index=False)
        
        print(f"The new data for {city} has been written to '{file_name}'.")

    # Update processed IDs
    new_processed_ids = set(df_merged["Customer Id"])
    processed_ids.update(new_processed_ids)
    save_processed_ids(processed_ids_file, processed_ids)

    print(f"Processed {len(df_merged)} new records.")
    print(f"Total records in processed IDs: {len(processed_ids)}")
    print(f"Files written for cities: {', '.join(df_merged['City'].unique())}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_new_records()

```

Here are the key changes and explanations:

1. The overall structure of the script remains the same, but we've ensured that all operations on `df_merged` are within the same function scope.

2. We've moved the creation and processing of `df_merged` earlier in the function, before the loop that writes individual city files.

3. We've added the suggested logging at the end of the function to list all cities for which files were written:

   ```python
   print(f"Files written for cities: {', '.join(df_merged['City'].unique())}")
   ```

4. The updating of processed IDs remains at the end of the function, ensuring all new records are processed before updating the file.

These modifications should resolve the 'df_merged is not defined' error you encountered. The script will now:

1. Properly create and process the `df_merged` DataFrame.
2. Write a file for each unique city among the new records.
3. Update the processed IDs file with all the new IDs at the end.
4. Provide a summary of the cities for which files were written.

This version of the script should run without the scoping error you encountered. It processes all new records, writes files for each city, and correctly updates the processed IDs.

If you encounter any further issues or have any questions about the changes, please don't hesitate to ask. We can continue to refine the script as needed.
